# optimal-path-Qlearning
The objective of this project is to find optimal path between any two nodes.
To achieve an optimal path in our project we used **Q- learning**, a model-free
reinforcement learning algorithm, aimed to learn the quality of actions and telling an
agent what action is to be taken under which circumstance. It does not require a model
of the environment (hence "model-free"), and it can handle problems with stochastic
transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations.
